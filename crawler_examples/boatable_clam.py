# Poke around https://github.com/microprediction/echochamber/blob/master/echochamber/crawler.py
# to see what this is doing. Some parameters to the Echo state network are:

# Feel free to mess with these or hyperoptimize
PARAMS = {'n_reservoir':25,        # ECN default 200
          'sparsity':0,            # Default 0

          'noise':0.002}           # Default 0.001

# Maybe you want this if you want to see if recent performance is trending in the right direction.
