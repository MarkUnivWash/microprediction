        "I don't assume that everyone reaching out wishes to support a crazy vision outlined in my [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and to some extent the [tldr](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/tldr.html) but that won't stop me mentioning it. Maybe you just want more jackass commentary on data science, or the occasional novelty in [portfolio theory](https://medium.com/geekculture/schur-complementary-portfolios-fix-hierarchical-risk-parity-28b0efa1f35f) and other things I work on in the open, when I can.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Here's something for you, or your students\n",
        "Indeed, I've no idea what you want but:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Maybe you or your students want a real, live, educational challenge [here](https://www.microprediction.com/knowledge-center)\n",
        "2.   Maybe you want to benchmark a prediction algorithm [here](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html)\n",
        "3.   Maybe you want to discover if it is good at something you didn't expect\n",
        "4.   Maybe you just want data. Help yourself [here](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/data.html).\n",
        "5.   Or you want to chat with technical people in the [slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html).\n",
        "6.   Or you might even feel like contributing to open source timeseries or optimization benchmarking. \n",
        "7.   Or not. \n",
        "8.   Or maybe you want to try to sell me a stock signal, in which case you might be in luck because I can, in fact, [evaluate them](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/signals) in realtime. \n",
        "9.   Or you are wealthy and would like to see a prediction web really happen. DM me for my routing number. \n",
        "\n",
        "Oh yes and I'm too crystalized to want or benefit from life coaching but thanks anyway. I work for a hedge fund and we like to see what algorithms are out there that work well, and we can also consume predictions without knowing your algorithm. It isn't a zero sum game. There's almost zero cost to your algorithms helping me or mine helping you. \n",
        "\n",
        "That is why you have found yourself in a colab notebook that makes it trivial to start participating in Microprediction contests. You'll be submitting predictions to multiple [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) and who knows, you might even win the [daily prize](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily).  We have an informal Google [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html) too on Fridays at noon New York time where I'm happy to explain more. It isn't crowded most weeks so if you reached out wishing to speak to me, that's where I'll be.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Before getting down to brass tacks, I shall politely ask you if you would like free prediction offered by the little-known microprediction API and client. I mostly just use it myself to reasonable effect, as it turns out, but in keeping with the sentiment above, it's really no skin off my nose to let you use the algorithmm swarm too (please be respectful though). \n",
        "\n",
        "So yes, I can provide you free distributional prediction of anything you can measure. See the [instructions](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html). \n",
        "\n",
        "One day, half of all data science will be done in this collective manner, I predict, but you know that already 'cause you read the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322), right?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Get started ... don't forget to run the previous cell\n",
        "\n",
        "Anyway, I've supplied this template that both initiates you into the microprediction community and then submits some predictions on your behalf. It should explain itself as it runs, sort of. Just click those arrows in sequence. "
