### Main limitation

Entering a microprediction contest in a one-off fashion will only work well if the distribution of the data is unchanging, for example if a
process is stationary and if the stream is set up so that *changes* in the stationary process are published. 

For many streams, it is necessary to submit frequently. See [predict_using_python_microcrawler](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict-using-python-microcrawler.html).
