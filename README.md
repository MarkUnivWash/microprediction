Hello you've found the microprediction repos and amazingly, some work. If you are looking for my "home page" see: 

  - [papers, articles etc](https://github.com/microprediction/home)

I like to provoke people into using market-inspired collective mechanisms for prediction. After all, a market beat 97% of participants in the M6 contest didn't it, eh? ([post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-options-market-beat-94-of-participants-activity-7020917422085795840-Pox0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and [announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spyros-makridakis-b2ba5a52_congratulations-to-the-global-winners-of-activity-7028775981133791232-Mlzs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)). There are more provocations in my [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/microprediction) too. 

And since you are here here's a new [MontePrediction](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) game you can play. Yes, if you'd like to participate in my latest experiment you merely open this [colab notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb), change the email, and run it. The notebook also describes the high dimensional game you'll be playing. 



### Stuff that works: benchmarking packages: [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines), [Precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise), and [HumpDay](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday)

These packages aspire to advance online autonomous prediction in a small way, but also help me notice if anyone else does.  


### Some of my other packages: 

- [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning) - A recently published fast algorithm for inferring relative ability from win probability. 
- [embarrassingly](https://github.com/microprediction/embarrassingly) - A speculative approach to robust optimization that sends impure objective functions to optimizers.
- [pandemic](https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic) - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck epidemic simulation (related [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10311))
- [firstdown](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown) - The repo that aspires to ruin the great game of football. See Wilmott [paper](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown/blob/main/wilmott_paper/44-49_Cotton_PDF5_Jan22%20(2).pdf).  
- [m6](https://github.com/microprediction/m6) - Illustrates fast numerical rank probability calculations, using [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning). However since the rules changed, this isn't that useful for M6 anymore. The [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise) package is way more useful, and put one person on the podium! 




## The currently defunct real-time time-series platform

The real-time system previously maintained by yours truly has entered a trisoloran dehydrated state but will hopefully be revived at a future date, after one of my three hundred ChatGPT generated scientific grant proposals is successful. Here's how some of the open-source stuff used to propagate down into the "algo fight club". 

1. The "[/skaters](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skaters)" provide canonical, single-line of code access to functionality drawn from packages like [river](https://github.com/online-ml/river), [pydlm](https://github.com/wwrechard/pydlm), [tbats](https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats), [pmdarima](http://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/), [statsmodels.tsa](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html), [neuralprophet](https://neuralprophet.com/), Facebook [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), 
   Uber's [orbit](https://eng.uber.com/orbit/), Facebook's [greykite](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/greykite--a-flexible--intuitive--and-fast-forecasting-library) and more. 
   
2. The [StreamSkater](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict-using-python-streamskater.html) makes it easy to use any "skater". 

3. Choices are sometimes advised by [Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/special-k_003.html), but anyone can do what they want. 

4. It's not too hard to use my [HumpDay](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday) package for offline meta-param tweaking, et cetera. 

5. It's not too hard to use my [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise) package for online ensembling. 

Those repose are: 

- The [muid](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) identifier package is explained in this [video](https://vimeo.com/397352413). 
- [microconventions](https://github.com/microprediction/microconventions) captures things common to client and server, and may answer many of your more specific questions about prediction horizons, et cetera.  
- [rediz](https://github.com/microprediction/rediz) contains server side code. For the brave. 
- There are other rats and mice like [getjson](https://github.com/microprediction/getjson), [runthis](https://github.com/microprediction/runthis) and [momentum](https://github.com/microprediction/momentum).
