Just go to [setup](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup) to instantly participate and grok microprediction. Or ping me a cal invite for Fridays 11:30am EST and I'll walk you through getting started deploying your models. See [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html). This was supposed to be the microprediction [client](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/microprediction) page btw but Github made this a "user page" and they know best. Hi, this is my [blog](https://www.microprediction.com/blog) and, oh, so is [this](https://microprediction.medium.com/). I've always worked in the private sector, though very occasionally [publish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V5wB8lEAAAAJ&hl=en). My [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/microprediction) is out now (buy, read, then complain at [/building_an_open_ai_network](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network)) and here's other [other stuff I've written](https://github.com/microprediction/home). I've been [annointed](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richadbecker_there-are-only-4-data-science-people-on-li-activity-6975483922784612352--JmQ) "influencer", aka LinkedIn jackass.  

I'm dynamic and fascinating. Not really but I run a [slack channel](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html) for those interested in time-series, covariance
prediction, optimization and other things enabling semi-autonomous collective microprediction. Most Friday's at noon
I make myself available to anyone interested in these things (see [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html)), even people selling me stuff on LI who read this far (most don't). I'm not big on creating other deterministic future work interruptions even though I do realize there is excellent tooling for this. 

# The [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines), [Precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise), and [HumpDay](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday) packages 

I maintain three benchmarking packages to help me, and maybe you, surf the open-source wave.

These packages aspire to advance online autonomous prediction in a small way, but also help me notice if anyone else does!  

# The [microprediction.org](https://www.microprediction.org/) platform
Just go to [setup](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup), really. 

I also maintain a *live exchange* (high velocity prediction market of sorts, in the broad category of colliders, per my [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/)'s outrageous neologism) where distributional time-series prediction
 algorithms (Python, R, Julia mostly) duke it out, trying to predict future values of [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html). 
Why? So my hedge fund can forever be at the forefront of open-source algorithmic advances that help predict [stocks](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/yarx) and related quantities. 
 
But there's a bigger picture too per the [book](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/) and let it not go unemphasized that there is $50,000 in prediction [prizes](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) up for grabs to foster progress in that direction. A prediction web will give clever people the opportunity to *let their algorithms help someone* without their getting in the middle, should they wish to. It remains a social experiment to determine whether that's sufficient motivation. You can see [examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) of what I've let loose and those will attack any problem you pose too. I'll send you to the better organized [documentation](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/) that supercedes this README, should you wish to either consume or supply prediction.  

No? Prefer to read an entire page before following links. Totally respect that. TLDR:

- I publish live data repeatedly, [like this](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_traffic/traffic_speed.py) say, and it
 creates a stream (like [this stream](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=c2_rebalanced_30_mean) or [this one](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=electricity-load-nyiso-overall) or any from the [listing](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html)). 
- Algorithms like [this guy](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples/soshed_boa.py) compete to make distributional predictions 1 min ahead, 5 min ahead, 15 min ahead and 1 hr ahead. 

In this way I can:
 - Get live prediction of public data for free (sometimes I make the "public" data obscure)
 - Indirectly benefit from [hundreds of packages](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/popular-timeseries-packages) from Github of uncertain quality, and not just Python.
 - Sip pina coladas while the accuracy magically improves over time. Read about [this example](https://medium.com/geekculture/an-empirical-article-that-wasnt-immediately-stale-720abfb4678f). 

Again, *should* you be interested in helping I'll 
point out that due to its obscurity, running this [script](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_skater_examples/datable_llama.py) makes a heck of a lot more economic sense than bitcoin mining - 
try it out or see the [docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction).
  
Just to lean on the differences between this and the other benchmarking efforts, the [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) package is traditional open-source software for *point-estimates* and confidence, whereas the [Microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) client offers live crowd based *distributional* prediction and also, in theory, exogenous data search. 

But the connection is provided by the fact that among the algorithms that compete at [Microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) quite a few use the [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) algorithms (see [/skaters](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skaters)), drawn from packages like [river](https://github.com/online-ml/river), [pydlm](https://github.com/wwrechard/pydlm), [tbats](https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats), [pmdarima](http://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/), [statsmodels.tsa](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html), [neuralprophet](https://neuralprophet.com/), Facebook [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), 
   Uber's [orbit](https://eng.uber.com/orbit/), Facebook's [greykite](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/greykite--a-flexible--intuitive--and-fast-forecasting-library) and more. Some are open source (look for CODE badges on [leaderboards](https://www.microprediction.org/leaderboard.html)) but others are private to their author.  

# [Memorable Unique Identifiers](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) and other platform repos

- The [muid](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) identifier package is explained in this [video](https://vimeo.com/397352413). 
- [microconventions](https://github.com/microprediction/microconventions) captures things common to client and server, and may answer many of your more specific questions about prediction horizons, et cetera.  
- [rediz](https://github.com/microprediction/rediz) contains server side code. For the brave. 
- There are other rats and mice like [getjson](https://github.com/microprediction/getjson), [runthis](https://github.com/microprediction/runthis) and [momentum](https://github.com/microprediction/momentum).  

# Some of my other packages: 

- [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning) - A recently published fast algorithm for inferring relative ability from win probability. 
- [embarrassingly](https://github.com/microprediction/embarrassingly) - A speculative approach to robust optimization that sends impure objective functions to optimizers.
- [pandemic](https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic) - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck epidemic simulation (related [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10311))
- [firstdown](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown) - The repo that aspires to ruin the great game of football. See Wilmott [paper](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown/blob/main/wilmott_paper/44-49_Cotton_PDF5_Jan22%20(2).pdf).  
- [m6](https://github.com/microprediction/m6) - Illustrates fast numerical rank probability calculations, using [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning). However since the rules changed, this isn't that useful for M6 anymore. The [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise) package is way more useful, and put one person on the podium!
