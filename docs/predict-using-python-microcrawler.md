The MicroCrawler class, found in [micropredicton/crawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/crawler.py) is intended to
make it easier to shauffeur algorithms from one stream to the next. 

### Running the default crawler


    from microprediction import MicroCrawler
    crawler = MicroCrawler(write_key='YOUR WRITE KEY')
    crawler.run()


### 








If you don't like MicroCrawler, you can [predict-using-python](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict-using-python.html) using the MicroWriter instead.
