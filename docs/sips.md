# One Hour Ahead Distributional Wind-Speed Predictions

It is easy to draw predictions made by algorithms into an Open SIPmath(tm) standard, so they can be used
in Monte Carlo or other calculations in Excel using ChanceCalc(tm). 

### SIP Library

For background on stochastic information packets (SIPs) see the Wikipedia entry on [probability management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_management). The microprediction site can be viewed as a source of real-time SIPs. Click on the logo to download a live wind speed distribution, and then use directly in ChanceCalc to make chance-informed decisions in Excel, or import into R, Python or the 
platform of your choice.
