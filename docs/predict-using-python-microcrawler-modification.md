## Microcrawler modifications


In [predict-using-python-microcrawler](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict-using-python-microcrawler.html) it was explained that overwriting the **sample** method will change the predictions that are
 made. However there are other modifications you might wish to make as well, and there are two main ways to do so. 
 - Parameters supplied when initializing MicroCrawler
 - Overriding methods in a MicroCrawler subclass.
