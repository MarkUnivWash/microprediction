## TLDR

Markets are better than models for short horizon prediction - but harder to wield, until now. 

If you are not remotely sympathetic to the first assertion, I'll have an uphill battle convincing you of anything. So let's focus on the
second assertion I make. You can [publish live data](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html) such as your own prediction model errors. This will create a market immediately where bots and their authors will try to find signal that you missed. 

For markets to work efficiently with almost no trade friction, participation by humans and inaminate autonomous algorithms should be seamless. If you are willing to [cut and paste one line](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) on bash command you'll be on the way to being convinced of that fact, since this will initiate your participation in a stripped-down improvement of an options market (no email or ISDA required). 

There's one more thing: recursion. By all means look at what [people are saying](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html) about
the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to wade deeper into this future vision of bespoke quantitative business optimization, powered by a million copies of what you see here, and improvements on the same.
