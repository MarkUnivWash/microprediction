## TLDR

Markets are better than models. But markets have been harder to wield, until now. 

If you are not remotely sympathetic to the first statement, good bye. Similarly, if you are not 
willing to [cut and paste one line](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) to immediately participate in an options market, thus demonstrating to yourself that progress has been made towards the second statement being true, then I probably can't convince you of anything in one paragraph. 

(Though by all means look
at what [people are saying](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html) about
the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to read it.)
