## TLDR

Markets are better than models for short horizon prediction. But markets have been harder to wield, until now. 

If you are not remotely sympathetic to the first statement, see you in a few years. Similarly, if you are not 
willing to [cut and paste one line](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) to immediately participate in a stripped-down improvement of an options market, thus demonstrating to yourself that progress has been made towards the second statement being true, then I probably can't convince you of anything in one paragraph. Unless, that is, you choose the other side of the coin and [publish live data](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html) such as your own prediction model errors. This will create a market immediately where bots and their authors will be rewarded for finding signal that you missed. 

That's all I got. Though by all means look at what [people are saying](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html) about
the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to read it.
