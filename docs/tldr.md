## TLDR

Markets are:
  
  1. Better than models for short horizon prediction, but
  2. Harder to wield, until now. 

If you are not remotely sympathetic to the first assertion, then space is too limited here but by all means join this [discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_tldr-activity-6983896509490610176-JTJB/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), or better, [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-options-market-beat-94-of-participants-activity-7020917422085795840-Pox0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) where I discuss my hijacking of the M6 Forecasting contest using a market. My contribution to the age old question of market efficacy - in the specific context of realtime operational intelligence - is made in Chapter 4 of the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) which you are welcome to [listen to](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/tree/main/docs/assets/audio).  

So let's focus on whether or not you can create and use a market as conveniently as a model. I think it helps to just do it and see. You can [publish live data](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html) such as your own prediction model errors. This will create a streamlined cousin of a market (read more [here](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/intro)) where bots and their authors will try to find signal that you missed. The only real question is whether you are as quick to grok this as 
[others have been](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomashthoresen_datascience-microprediction-timeseriesforecasting-activity-6999971006274514944-lDID?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). 

Now for markets you create on the fly to work efficiently with almost no trade friction, participation by humans and inaminate autonomous algorithms should be seamless. If you are willing to [cut and paste one line](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) on bash command or open a [colab notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/notebook_examples_submission/thanks_for_reaching_out.ipynb) and run it, you'll be on the way to being convinced of that fact, since this will initiate your participation in a stripped-down improvement of an options market (no email or ISDA required). 

There are other important ideas such as recursion, privacy, and the reformulation of control theory and reinforcement learning. By all means look at what [people are saying](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html) about
the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to wade deeper into this future vision of bespoke quantitative business optimization, powered by a million copies of what you see here, and improvements on the same.
