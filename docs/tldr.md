## TLDR

Markets are better than models. But markets have been harder to wield, until now. 

If you are not remotely sympathetic to the first statement, or you are not willing to [cut and paste one line](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) to immediately participate in an options market, then I probably can't convince you of anything in one paragraph. By all means look
at what [people are saying](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html) about
the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to read it. Otherwise, see you 
in a few years when this has reached the Towards Data Science echo chamber.
