If you are not remotely sympathetic, I probably can't convince you of anything in one paragraph. By all means look

the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) and decide to read it. Otherwise, see you 
in a few years when this has reached to Towards Data Science echo chamber.
