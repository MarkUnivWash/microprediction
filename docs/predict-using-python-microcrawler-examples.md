## Crawling Examples 

Two ways to find examples of MicroCrawler

- See example directories in github:
  - [microprediction/crawler_examples_basic](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_examples_basic) is a good start. 
  - [microprediction/crawler_examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_examples) contains code for many live crawlers.
  - [microprediction/crawler_examples_modification](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_examples_modification) has suggestively named files, such as:
     - [crawler_associated_with_email](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples_modification/crawler_associated_with_email.py) ... to add your email
     - [crawler_for_short_horizons](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples_modification/crawler_for_short_horizons.py) shows how to modify choice of prediction horizon.
     - [crawler_for_specific_stream_sponsor](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples_modification/crawler_for_specific_stream_sponsor.py) useful for chasing prizes
   and so on.
  - [microprediction/crawler_skater_examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_skater_examples) show how to "skate".
