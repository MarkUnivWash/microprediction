If you just wanted more grumpy comments in your feed that's cool. Not everybody wants to read my [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/). Although, you could do me a solid and justify my
project's existence just by cutting and pasting this bash script into a terminal. 

     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/32jjebu9)"

I promise this will be a data science life changing event. If you are sensibly skeptical of random bash commands (what could go wrong?) then
read [this](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup).
