 Microprediction is a concept that leverages a network of micro-managers, which are algorithms that compete in various prediction contests to provide valuable insights and data. These contests can be thought of as "deep contests" that tap into the wisdom of the statistical crowd.

The microprediction approach is supported by both empirical success in data science contests and the theoretical efficiency of contests. It aims to make use of the abundant human talent that can contribute to solving a wide range of problems through the development of traveling micro-managers.

A major goal of microprediction is to achieve a diversity of live, streaming, distributional prediction contests, which can provide real-time insights and value to various industries and fields. These contests have the potential to bring about a more efficient way of sourcing insights and data by encouraging collaboration and competition among algorithms.
