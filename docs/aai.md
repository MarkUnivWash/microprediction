# Center for Artificial Artificial Intelligence 

A new initiative designed to bring together all sides in harmony. 

### Why do we need AAI? 
The problem:

- Artifical Intelligence (AI) is clearly just hype. 
- This puts humanity at risk. Or it doesn't. Nobody can decide. 
- A hundred million people want to use AI, but some worry that they don't know what they are doing with it. 
- Or we should regulate it away.
- Or we should even regulate a different approach to AI that is completely unproven. 
- Or we should regulate away a path to accurate AI that runs through inaccurate AI. 

We can have the best of all worlds by calling it Artificial Artificial Intelligence (AAI) and avoiding any possible confusion. 

### A quick review of the argument against machines being intelligent

- AI can't really think because it is artificial. 
- Just backprop or simple rules.
- And you are a hype-monkey if you suggest otherwise. 
- And you are so irresponsible for suggesting that a machine could do lots of different things quite intelligently.
- And Theranos, and blockchain.   
- And something really, really vague about quantum computing from Penrose
- And some examples of things ChatGPT got wrong last year. Oh wait, [most are fixed](https://microprediction.medium.com/remind-me-again-why-large-language-models-cant-think-acab12da63de) already.   

### The hype problem

- Humanity is as dumb as a rock so you have an obligation to avoid them getting confused...
- ... by all the people claiming that more than "sparks of AGI".
- Oh wait, nobody can actually point to a single paper claiming more than sparks of AGI.
- But its a massive hype problem, clearly. 
- Caused by computer scientists, statisticians, or other abstraction-and oversimplification-oriented individuals [source](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056580712321216512?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7056580712321216512%2C7056590319382884352%29&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7056580712321216512%2C7056638793025495041%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287056590319382884352%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7056580712321216512%29&dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287056638793025495041%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7056580712321216512%29).
- Just ask the 100 million users of ChatGPT. They are all idiots.  
- I'm probably missing something

### Let's all get along: 

1. Things that act intelligently across a stunningly broad spectrum of tasks can be labelled AAI without the risk of enraging anyone. 
2. Human egos are absolutely safe in all other respects. 


### FAQ:

But it already says "artificial" in AI

Oh right, yes so it does. 


### Where can I learn more about AAI? 

It isn't clear that humans can truly learn. But if you would like to build algorithms that fake it:
