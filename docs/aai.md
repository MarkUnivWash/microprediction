# Center for Artificial Artificial Intelligence 

A new initiative designed to bring together all sides in harmony. 

### Why do we need AAI? 

Artifical Intelligence (AI) is clearly just hype. This puts humanity at risk. Or it doesn't. Nobody can decidee. Calling it 
Artificial Artificial Intelligence (AAI) avoids any possible confusion. 
Look, AI can't really think because it is artificial. End of story. But with AAI expectations are set:

1. Artificial artificial output avoids the perception that everything to come out of an LLM should be true. 
2. Things that act intelligently across a stunningly broad spectrum of tasks can be labelled AAI without the risk of enraging anyone. 
3. Human egos are absolutely safe in all other respects. 


### But it already says "artificial" in AI

Oh right, yes so it does. 

### Might this be confused with turking?

Yeah that too. Apologies to Bezos.
