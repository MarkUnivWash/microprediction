# Center for Artificial Artificial Intelligence 

A new initiative designed to bring together all sides in harmony. 

### Why do we need AAI? 

Artifical Intelligence (AI) is clearly just hype. This puts humanity at risk. Calling it 
Artificial Artificial Intelligence (AAI) avoids any possible confusion. 

AI can't really think because it is artificial. 

### But it already says "artificial" in AI

Oh right, yes so it does.
