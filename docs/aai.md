# Center for Artificial Artificial Intelligence 

A new initiative designed to bring together all sides in harmony. 

### Why do we need AAI? 
The problem:

- Artifical Intelligence (AI) is clearly just hype. 
- This puts humanity at risk. Or it doesn't. Nobody can decide. 
- A hundred million people want to use AI, but some worry that they don't know what they are doing with it. 
- Calling it Artificial Artificial Intelligence (AAI) avoids any possible confusion. 

A quick review of the reductionist argument:

- AI can't really think because it is artificial. 
- Just backprop or simple rules.
- And you are a hype-monkey if you suggest otherwise. 
- And you are so irresponsible for suggesting that a machine could do lots of different things quite intelligently
- Because humanity is as dumb as a rock so you have an obligation to avoid them getting confused. 
- And something really, really vague about quantum computing from Penrose
- And some examples of things ChatGPT got wrong last year. 
- I'm probably missing something

Let's all get along: 

1. Things that act intelligently across a stunningly broad spectrum of tasks can be labelled AAI without the risk of enraging anyone. 
2. Human egos are absolutely safe in all other respects. 


### FAQ:

But it already says "artificial" in AI

Oh right, yes so it does. 


### Where can I learn more about AAI? 

It isn't clear that humans can truly learn. But if you would like to build algorithms that fake it:
