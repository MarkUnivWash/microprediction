The use of lightweight overfitting-free automated prediction is [catching on](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomashthoresen_datascience-microprediction-timeseriesforecasting-activity-6999971006274514944-lDID?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). This roadmap isn't
about limiting your own imagination and please continue to add to the [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html). However in addition to whatever
anyone else chooses to do, I want to explain here briefly some directions.  


### Microprediction fund

Currently the economics for participation involve relatively small prizes intended to add to the scientific incentives for participation (free benchmarking of algorithms etc). 

But, I'm all in on creating a fund under the Intech Investments umbrella that is driven in real-time by microprediction streams. While nothing written here constitutes
a guarrantee, advice or anything else, the intent among the management of Intech is that microprediction participants could share in the management fees of this fund. 

In broad brush terms, the use of the microprediction platform in this particular context is rather different to present or past alpha-chasing initiatives like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantconnect and so forth,
all of which are interesting in their own way. 

Some things that delineate the microprediction fund from the investment industry competition can include:

   - Directly addressing the primary pitfall with portfolio selection methodologies: overfitting. 
   
   - Generating novel sources of information as artifacts of prediction competitions on live equity prices changes
  
   - A more rigorous approach to defensive diversified portfolio construction (various threads here, including [Schur portfolios](https://medium.com/geekculture/schur-complementary-portfolios-fix-hierarchical-risk-parity-28b0efa1f35f)
   
   - Incorporation of ideas from Intech's long history. 

This field is highly competitive, but Intech's 35 year track record and extensive institutional relationships mean that if a high quality product can be created it can also be sold.
