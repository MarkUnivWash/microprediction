The use of lightweight overfitting-free automated prediction is [catching on](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomashthoresen_datascience-microprediction-timeseriesforecasting-activity-6999971006274514944-lDID?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I hope there are many varied ways in which it used, and hopefully you all continue to add to the [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html). 

However, in addition to whatever
anyone else chooses to do, I want to explain here briefly a direction that might significantly change the economics of the whole system.  Currently the economics for participation involve relatively small prizes intended to add to the scientific incentives for participation (free benchmarking of algorithms etc). 


### Microprediction fund

I'm all in on creating a fund under the Intech Investments umbrella that is driven in real-time by microprediction streams. While nothing written here constitutes a guarrantee, advice or anything else, the intent among the management of Intech is that microprediction participants could share in the management fees of this fund. 

To address up front a frequent question, the use of the microprediction platform in this particular context is very different to present or past alpha-chasing initiatives like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantconnect and so forth, all of which are interesting in their own way, but none of which have any strong predictive ability when it comes to the microprediction fund.  

The real competition lies elsewhere in the investment industry, including passive investing. But some things that delineate the microprediction fund from the institutional competition can include:

   - A novel way to directly addressing the primary pitfall with portfolio selection methodologies: namely overfitting. 
   
   - The generation of novel sources of information as artifacts of prediction competitions on live equity prices changes.
  
   - A more rigorous approach to defensive diversified portfolio construction. There are various threads to this research, not all public, but see for example my work on [Schur portfolios](https://medium.com/geekculture/schur-complementary-portfolios-fix-hierarchical-risk-parity-28b0efa1f35f). 
   
   - Incorporation of ideas from Intech's long history. 

Notice that success is *not* predicated on 

   - Direct discovery of alpha in prediction algorithm submissions

although that would be a nice bonus. 

This field is highly competitive, but Intech's 35 year track record and extensive institutional relationships mean that if a high quality product can be created it can also be sold.
