The use of lightweight overfitting-free automated prediction is [catching on](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomashthoresen_datascience-microprediction-timeseriesforecasting-activity-6999971006274514944-lDID?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I hope there are many varied ways in which it used, and hopefully you all continue to add to the [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html). 

# Microprediction Fund 

However, in addition to whatever
anyone else chooses to do, I want to explain here briefly a direction that might significantly change the economics of the whole system.  Currently the economics for participation involve relatively small prizes intended to add to the scientific incentives for participation (free benchmarking of algorithms etc). 

### Incentive

I'm all in on creating a fund under the Intech Investments umbrella that is driven in real-time by microprediction streams. While nothing written here constitutes a guarrantee, advice or anything else, the intent among the management of Intech is that:

 - Microprediction participants should share in the upside. 
 
 - Said sharing can be transparent (e.g. linear).   

### Delineation 

To address up front a frequent question, the use of the microprediction platform in this particular context is *very* different to present or past alpha-chasing initiatives like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantconnect and so forth, all of which are interesting in their own way, but none of whose track records necessarily imply any strong predictive ability when it comes to the microprediction fund. 

Actually, its my view that there is plenty of room for collaboration with those ventures and learning from them (I'm grateful to Jonathan Larkin and Richard Craib for interesting discussions) and that the real competition lies elsewhere in the investment industry, including very serious competition from passive investing. 

Some things that delineate the microprediction fund from past crowd-sourcing efforts but also, more importantly, the broader institutional investing competition can include:

   - Crowd-sourcing of *explicit* horizon-based predictions of various kinds, and prediction of intermediate and derived quantities including in-house model residuals. It is worth comparing this approach to the very difficult task of combining together trading strategies whose intent is unknown. It is the opinion, if I may speak for him, of Jonathan Larkin that this was the primary challenge faced by Quantopian.  

   - A novel way to directly addressing the primary pitfall with portfolio selection methodologies: namely overfitting. The microprediction platform is not the only way to attack this, naturally, but it arguably represents a state of elegance compared to, say, the human-heavy organizational framework advocated by Lopez de Prado say ([book](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089)).  
   
   - The generation of novel sources of information as artifacts of prediction competitions on live equity prices changes. Perhaps the closest analogy here lies with Echo state networks (reservoir computing). 
   
   - A ruthless way to chain together distributional transforms from combinations of different people's algorithms (stay tuned for advances in the platform that facilitate ideas closer to Ch3 and Ch5 of my book).  
  
   - A more rigorous approach to defensive diversified portfolio construction. There are various threads to this research, not all public, but see for example my work on [Schur portfolios](https://medium.com/geekculture/schur-complementary-portfolios-fix-hierarchical-risk-parity-28b0efa1f35f). 
      
   - Incorporation of investment ideas from Intech's long history. 


Notice that success is *not* predicated on: 

   - Direct discovery of alpha in prediction algorithm submissions

although that would be a nice bonus. That is not a hurdle I wish to set for myself, and fortunately it is not a prerequisite for success. 

### Distribution

This field is highly competitive, but Intech's 35 year track record and extensive institutional relationships mean that if a high quality product can be created it can also be sold.
