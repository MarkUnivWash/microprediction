## Transfers

To avoid [bankruptcy](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/bankruptcy.html), 
it is possible to transfer balance from one `write_key` to another. You can also just message
me in the [slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html)! 

Balance may be transferred from one `write_key` to another if the recipient `write_key` has a negative balance. You can use the transfer function to keep
a `write_key` alive that you need for sponsoring a stream. 

You cannot use a transfer to 
raise the balance associated with a `write_key` above zero - that is only possible by means of accurate prediction.
