## Google Meet-ups

Friday noon EST most weeks. See the [slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html) channel for invite and cancellations.

The microprediction Google Meet:

 - Is a good way to get off to a flying start and be eligible for [prizes](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/prizes.html).
 - Serves as "office hours" for anyone with questions about microprediction. 
 - Contributor or user discussion for the [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines), [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise) or [humpday](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday) packages, or any others I maintain. 
 - Bemoaning of performance in the [M6 Financial forecasting contest](https://m6competition.com/Leaderboard)
 - Complaints about my [book](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/issues).
 - General discussion of timeseries, optimization, autonomous machine learning and so forth.
