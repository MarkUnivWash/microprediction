A free, stable platform illustrating live, collective "microprediction", the topic of a new [book](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/book.html).

## 1. Turnkey live prediction ([>> publishing docs >>](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html))

The [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) at
microprediction.org are all created by people who repeatedly publish ground truths. Algorithms
poll these streams and the ongoing battles produce 
beautiful community cumulative distribution functions, such as the [CDF](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=faang_1&horizon=3555) representing the 1-hour ahead
forecasts of the logarithm of META price changes. You can create your own stream by:
 - Modifying [create_a_stream.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/create_a_stream.py) and running it, just to get in the game. 
 - Then perusing the [PUBLISH](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html)  documentation.

## 2. Turnkey benchmarking ([>> prediction docs >>](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html))

On the other hand, you can easily test *distributional time-series prediction* algorithms by: 

 - Modifying the script
[enter_die_contest_one_off.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/enter_die_contest_one_off.py) and running it, just to get started.
 - Reviewing the [PREDICT](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html) docs for much more useful patterns. 

There are [rewards](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) for good prediction determined daily. 

## Not to be overlooked:

 - [Setup](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) will get you participating in under a minute.
 - [Slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html) channel and Friday google [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html).
 - [Glossary](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/glossary.html) and [summary](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/summary.html) of key API commands.
 - [Video](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/videos.html) tutorials, free [data](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/data.html) and [prizes](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/prizes.html). 
 - Limited [consulting](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/consulting.html) to help you assess vendors. 
 
 To chase the daily $125 [prize](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) for prediction, it is suggested that you join the [slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html) or Friday [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html) so we can help you get started.
