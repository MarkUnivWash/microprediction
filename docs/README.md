A free, stable platform illustrating "microprediction" ([long story](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/) or [tldr](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/tldr.html)). Go to [setup](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup) to participate in seconds.


## 1. Turnkey live prediction (see [publishing docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html))

You can create your own stream by:
 - Modifying [create_a_stream.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/create_a_stream.py) and running it, just to get in the game. 
 - Then perusing the [publising docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html) for more conveniences. 

## 2. Turnkey benchmarking (see [prediction docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html))

On the other hand, you can easily test *distributional time-series prediction* algorithms by: 

 - Modifying the script
[enter_die_contest_one_off.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/enter_die_contest_one_off.py) and running it, just to get started.
 - Reviewing the [prediction docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html) for submission patterns more likely to generalize.

## Brief explanation

The [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) at
microprediction.org are all created by people who repeatedly publish ground truths. Algorithms
poll these streams and the ongoing battles produce 
beautiful community cumulative distribution functions, such as the [CDF](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=faang_1&horizon=3555) representing the 1-hour ahead
forecasts of the logarithm of META price changes. There are [rewards](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) for good prediction determined daily. 


## Not to be overlooked:

 - [Setup](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/setup.html) will get you participating immediately. 
 - [Slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html) channel and Friday google [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html).
