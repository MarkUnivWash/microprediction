The microprediction platform offers you two key pieces of functionality:

## 1. Crowd-sourced live prediction ([>>PUBLISH >>](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html))

The [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) at
microprediction.org are all created by people who repeatedly publish ground truths. Algorithms
poll these streams and the ongoing battles produce 
beautiful community cumulative distribution functions, such as the [CDF](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=faang_1&horizon=3555) representing the 1-hour ahead
forecasts of the logarithm of META price changes. 

You can create your own stream by:
 - Modifying [create_a_stream.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/create_a_stream.py) and running it. 
 - Perusing [publish](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html)  documentation, for non-python options, polling patterns, and examples.   

## 2. Benchmarking of algorithms ([>> PREDICT >>](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html))

On the other hand, you can easily test prediction algorithms by: 

 - Modifying the script
[enter_die_contest_one_off.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/hello_world/enter_die_contest_one_off.py) and running it.
 - Or review [predict](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html) for patterns addressing more useful examples. 

## Highlights

 - Daily $125 [prize](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) for prediction.  
 - Use a [colab notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/notebook_examples/New_Key.ipynb) to get your WRITE_KEY. 
 - Join the [slack](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/slack.html). 
 - Regular Friday Google [meet](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/meet.html)
 - Free [data](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/data.html).
