# Consulting

On a limited basis, Microprediction LLC can help firms independently assess vendor solutions.

### Advantages

We maintain [various benchmarking packages](https://github.com/microprediction) and a live competitive platform.   

### Suitability

Some questions to ask:

1. Is your data live?  
2. Is the problem inherently a time-series prediction problem, or more regression?  
3. Does the vendor provide distributional predictions (distribution functions) or merely point estimates and confidence intervals?
4. Can the assessement be performed with non-confidential data?
5. Is the prediction problem relatively short horizon (1 min to 1 hour)? 

If the answer is no, then some assessment of vendor solutions is still possible, for instance using the timemachines package. However these questions hint at the sweet spot for engagement with Microprediction LLC. If the answers are mostly yes, it would be hard to imagine a better way to assess your potential solutions. 

### Self-assessment

You are, of course, free to use the platform yourself (see [publish](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html)) or the 
benchmarking packages (see [github/microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction)).
