# Consulting

On a limited basis, Microprediction LLC can help firms independently assess vendor solutions.

### Advantages

As we maintain [various benchmarking packages](https://github.com/microprediction) and a live competitive platform, we are uniquely placed.  

### Suitability

Some questions to ask:

1. Is your data live?  
2. Is the problem inherently a time-series prediction problem, or more regression?  
3. Does the vendor provide distributional predictions (distribution functions) or merely point estimates and confidence intervals?
4. Can the assessement be performed with non-confidential data?

If the answer is no, then some assessment of vendor solutions is still possible. However these questions hint at the 
sweet spot for engagement with Microprediction LLC.
