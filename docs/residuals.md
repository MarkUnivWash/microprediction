# Ongoing model residual analysis
The no-brainer use of the world's only microprediction oracle. See Chapter 9 of the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/). 

### Steps:
   
   1. Publish model residuals (see [publishing docs](https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/publish.html))
 

### Why?

Someone, somewhere might have deployed an algorithm that finds signal in your noise. Or they might in the future. 

### What happens:

 - You'll add to the list of [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html).
 - Algorithms (Python, Julia, R mostly) fight to predict your residuals (distributionally)
 - The ongoing battles produce beautiful community cumulative distribution functions, such as the [CDF](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=faang_1&horizon=3555) representing the 1-hour ahead
forecasts of the logarithm of META price changes. 
 - You may glean quite a lot from the outcome of that fight.  


### Optional steps:

   2. (optional) Submit a distributional prediction of your own residuals (see [prediction docs (https://microprediction.github.io/microprediction/predict.html)) 

   3. Check with compliance. 

   4. Use set_repository() method to point people to a page containing information. 
   
   6. Add to the [rewards](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily) for good prediction determined daily.

### Why is Intech allowing other funds to use this?
