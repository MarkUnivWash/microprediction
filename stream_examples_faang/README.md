## MultiChangePoll


For a minimalist example of using MultiChangePoll see [faang_simple.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_faang/faang.py). In contrast [faang.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_faang/faang.py) is more complicated as it uses the change_func option
to expand the set of numbers that are published.
