## MultiChangePoll


For a minimalist example of using MultiChangePoll see [faang_simple.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_faang/faang_simple.py). In contrast [faang.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_faang/faang.py) is more complicated as it uses the change_func option
to expand the set of numbers that are published. 


## Daily Prize 

The [faang.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_faang/faang.py) example also provides some transparency into the creation of some streams used for the [daily prize](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily). Some conventions for FAANG stocks and portfolios thereof can be found in the utilities [live/faang.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/live/faang.py) included in the microprediction client.
