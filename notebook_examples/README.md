The first colab notebook example you should try is 

 * [first submission](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_die/first_submission.ipynb)

That will get you an identity, and some credits. 

### Why aren't there lots of notebook examples? 

There aren't too many notebook examples here because to compete successfully you need a running process indefinitely, or a regularly scheduled script to run. There are tutorials starting at [Python module 1](https://www.microprediction.com/python-1).

### Colab issues

If using Colab, we suggest starting the session by removing numpy 

    !pip uninstall numpy -y
    !pip install microprediction
